    <h1>Withdrawal Profile & Rules (پیسے نکالنے کے اصول)</h1>

    <h3 class="animated-description">1. The Importance of Accuracy (درست معلومات کی اہمیت)</h3>
    <p>Your Withdrawal Profile is the most critical part of getting paid. Providing 100% accurate information is your responsibility. Any error in your payment details can lead to significant delays or even the permanent loss of your funds. Double-check every digit and every letter before submitting a withdrawal request.</p>
    <p>Withdrawal request karte waqt, Apna account number, account title (naam), aur mobile number bilkul sahi likhein. Ek choti si ghalti se aapki payment ghalat jagah ja sakti hai ya ruk sakti hai. Ghalat maloomat faraham karne ki soorat mein, hum payment ke nuqsan ke zimmedar nahi honge.</p>

    <h3>2. The Withdrawal Process Flow (پیسے نکالنے کا مکمل عمل)</h3>
    <p>When you request a withdrawal, it goes through several stages:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Request Submitted (درخواست جمع ہوگئی):</strong> You submit a request from the withdrawal page. The amount is deducted from your wallet and is now locked for processing.</li>
      <li><strong>Pending Review (جائزے کے لیے زیر التوا):</strong> Your request enters a queue. During this stage, our team has not yet started reviewing it.</li>
      <li><strong>In-Depth Review & Processing (تفصیلی جائزہ):</strong> This is the most important stage. Our team performs a rigorous audit of your account, which includes:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Task Compliance Check:</strong> We manually and automatically review your recent task history. We check if you have followed all instructions, respected timers, and completed tasks honestly. <strong>This is the number one reason for rejection. Any evidence of cutting corners or violating task rules will result in immediate rejection.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Fraud Check:</strong> We check your account for any signs of prohibited activities, such as multiple accounts from the same IP, VPN usage, or bot-like activity. Location data may be used to verify consistent and legitimate usage patterns.</li>
          <li><strong>Payment Detail Verification:</strong> We ensure your provided payment details are in the correct format.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="animated-description"><strong>Approved / Rejected (منظور / مسترد):</strong> Based on the review, your request is either approved or rejected.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Approved:</strong> If approved, the funds are sent to your specified account. Please allow 24-72 business hours for the funds to reflect.</li>
          <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> If rejected, the funds are returned to your app wallet (unless the rejection was due to severe fraud, in which case the account is banned). You will see the "Rejected" status in your history.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="animated-description">3. Common Reasons for Withdrawal Rejection (مسترد ہونے کی عام وجوہات)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>FAILURE TO FOLLOW TASK INSTRUCTIONS: This is the most common reason.</strong></li>
      <li>Providing incorrect payment details (wrong account number, name mismatch).</li>
      <li>Suspicion of using bots, VPNs, or multiple accounts.</li>
      <li>Not meeting the minimum withdrawal threshold.</li>
      <li>Requesting withdrawal before any mandatory holding period is over.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="animated-description"><strong>Final Decision:</strong> The decision made by our review team regarding any withdrawal request is final and not subject to appeal, especially in cases of clear violation of our terms and task rules.</p>
